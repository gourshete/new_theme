Recently I was calling create method on an active-record model object. But it failed in validation, because 
the provided foreign_key_id was not present in the associated table.
 

My first guess was it might be a dangling reference.
 But I was wrong. There was a record with this foreign_key_id in its table. So what went wrong? It was a problem with 
 `default scope` defined on an associated model.
 
 Let's first understand how scopes work in Rails. When we define a scope on an ActiveRecord model
      
      class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
        scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }
      end
 
 a class method is added to the Model. It is simply like this

      class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
        def self.red
          where(color:'red')
        end
      end

That means instead of querying `Vehicle.where(color:'red')`, we would be simply doing

      Vehicle.red


The object returned by scope is always an `ActiveRecord::Relation` not `Array`. And this is the greatest benefit, because you can call all
the queries on this object just like any other `Relation` object.

      Vehicle.red
      Vehicle.red.count
      Vehicle.red.where(type: 'Hatchback')

`You should always pass a callable object to the scopes defined with #scope. This ensures that the scope is re-evaluated each
time it is called.`

.

### Default Scope

What if we need to query `Vehicle` model with some pre-fixed parameters. Suppose requirement is to show vehicles of drive type 
'Gear' only. We must add the `where(drive_type: 'Gear')` clause to all the requests. Is there a better way with scopes?

Yes!! 

Just by defining `default scope` we would be able to query the drive_type geared vehicles only. Just like

      class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
        default_scope {where(drive_type: 'gear')}
      end
 
This will add `where(drive_type: 'gear')` to all the request we make to `Vehicle`.

This is just one way to use default scope. You can use default scopes `n` number of times in a Model. They all will be
club together in the resulting query.

      class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
        default_scope {where(drive_type: 'gear')}
        default_scope {where(color: 'red')}
      end


In this way we are able to filter each request on Model with default scope.

..

### Unscoped

As much as we need `default scope`, we may also need to undo it at some places. It means calling a plain query on a Model without 
any pre-defined clause/s. It can be just like

      Vehicle.unscoped.count
      
It will result `Vehicle.count` by removing default clause `where(drive_type: 'gear')`

...

### How associations work with Scopes

Scopes have effect on associated classes. The default scope
will take effect when a parent class makes query to the associated class. Just like

      class Klass < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_many :vehicles
      end

      class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
        belongs_to :klass
        default_scope {where(drive_type: 'gear')}
      end

When a query is made from `klass` object to `vehicles`, the default scope   `drive_type: 'gear'` will be auto considered.

....

### Extended Scopes

Scopes can be extended to have methods defined within themselves. Suppose 

      class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
        scope :geared, -> {where(drive_type: 'gear')} do
          def count
            count
          end
          
          def pluck_ids
            pluck(:id)
          end
      end
    
Calling `Vehicle.geared.count` would be equivalent to `Vehicle.where(drive_type: 'gear').count` and likewise for `pluck_ids`.

...

### Why not class methods?

From all the discussion about scopes, you might think why not use class methods instead? And yes it is absolutely fine to choose
class methods over scopes. The only problem I see for now is the difference between how we handle the chain-ability of relations.

For instance, consider

      #Scopes
      class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
        scope :color, -> color { where(color: color) }
        scope :gear, -> { where(drive_type: 'gear') }
      end

      #Class method
      class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
        def self.color(color)
          where(color: color)
        end
        
        def self.gear
          where(drive_type: 'gear')
        end
      end
      
When we call `Vehicle.color('red').gear`, it would absolutely work. But for `Vehicle.color('').gear` we won't get any result,
because the argument passed to color is blank. And it won't be a desired output. If argument is nil or blank we would want to get
all result instead. And will do this like

      #Scopes
      class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
        scope :color, -> color { where(color: color) if color.present? }
      end

      #Class method
      class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
        def self.color(color)
          if color.present?
            where(color: color)
          else
            all
          end
        end
      end

It is upto you what to choose. But I think we should consider what framework has to offer before re-inventing the wheel.

...

### Edge case

Let's assume data for more clear picture

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/scopes_1.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="">

`state_id` is present in every `cities` record. And `State` model has a default scope on `column_1` as `where(column_1: 1)`.

      class State < ActiveRecord::Base
        scope :one, -> { where(column_1: 1) }
        has_many :cities
      end

      class City < ActiveRecord::Base
        belongs_to :state
      end

To insert `{name:'New York', state_id: 1}` into `cities`, record with id 1 must exist in `states` table. But what if `states` id
1 has `column_1` set to 2 or any value other than 1. Will the default scope neglect them? Absolutely Yes!! 

The insertion query will fail with error message `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: State must exist`.

Then, what is the solution?

      class State < ActiveRecord::Base
        scope :one, -> { where(column_1: 1) }
        has_many :cities
      end

      class City < ActiveRecord::Base
        belongs_to :state, ->{where(column_1: [1, 2, 3])}
      end

Defining allowed `column_1` values in the association itself will do the trick.


Cheers!!!
