Postgresql provides a data-type `jsonb` to save data from JSON format. There are two ways for it - using `json`
and `jsonb`. This article will clarify difference in short terms.

`json` and `jsonb` are very similar to each other. The key difference is - `jsonb` is binary representation of `json` -
as per postgresql documentation.

- Pros -  `jsonb`

1. Improved efficiency
2. Postgresql provides query interface for these types. So a direct query for any key in column can be made.
3. Simple database schema

- Cons -  `jsonb`

1. Slight overhead to convert into binary form.
2. Aggregate queries are slower (due to lack of statistics).
3. Due to large table footprints may take large disk space.
